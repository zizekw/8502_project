# Question 1

## Question 1a
Check for linear correlations between the input variables (numeric)

```{r 1a}
# remove non-numeric columns
data_numeric_only <- data %>% select_if(is.numeric)

# now we can create our corrplot
M <- cor(data_numeric_only)
corrplot(M, method = "number", tl.col = "black", type = "upper")
```
Yes, there are a few variables positively correlated with each other and a select few negatively correlated. Of note, `emp.var.rate` is positively correlated with `cons.price.idx`, `euribor3m`, and `nr.employed` >0.78 for each.
